I chose the Student view.
Aggregation Roots: Disciplina,Student,Profesor, Nota.
I created a Generic Repository
For each aggregation root I created a Repository and a Factory.
I introduced MVC concepts.
I created a simple view and a small database in SQL Studio Management in order to make the connection, but I could not display the data in the view.
